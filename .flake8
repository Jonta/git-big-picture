[flake8]
# NOTE: The idea is to start with non-critical checks disabled
#       so that we can activate flake8 without a huge diff
#       upfront to already benefit from all still enabled checks,
#       and remove issue a class at a time, potentially
#       even multiple at once if we start using an auto-reformatter.
